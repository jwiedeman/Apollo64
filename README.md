# Apollo 11 Real-Time Mission Simulator

This repository has been reset to develop a real-time Apollo 11 mission simulator that can run both as a browser-based proof of concept and, eventually, as a Nintendo 64 experience. All design goals and roadmap details live in [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md), with milestone-specific execution notes collected under [`docs/milestones/`](docs/milestones).

## Repository Layout
- `js/` – Workspace for the JavaScript/Web prototype that will validate the mission model and user experience.
- `n64/` – Workspace for the libdragon-powered Nintendo 64 port that inherits the proven systems from the web build.
- `docs/` – Planning and reference material for the project, including the current mission and technology plan.
- `scripts/ingest/` – Planned notebooks and helper modules that turn annotated research assets into the committed datasets.

## Current Progress
- Milestone M0 datasets now cover launch through splashdown, capturing extended Passive Thermal Control maintenance, MCC-1/2/3/4 PAD workflows, LOI-focused navigation realignments, DOI planning, LM separation, powered descent and landing safing, surface EVA-1 prep/egress/traverse/closeout, ascent/docking evaluation, TEI preparation and execution, transearth DSN communications passes, MCC-5 return corrections, entry PAD alignment, service module jettison, and recovery procedures.
- A new `docs/data/consumables.json` pack records baseline power, propellant, and life-support budgets with citations into the Apollo 11 Mission Operations Report and Flight Plan, enabling simulation modules to initialize realistic resource margins.
- Fresh `docs/data/thrusters.json` geometry maps the CSM and LM reaction-control clusters (radius, angles, translation/torque axes, and thrust/impulse defaults) so Milestone M2 can plug guidance tuning directly into the simulator.
- `docs/data/audio_cues.json` now catalogs buses, categories, and prioritized cues (alerts, callouts, telemetry hints, UI feedback, and ambience) pulled from Apollo 11 transcripts and Mission Operations Report references, and the mission data loader surfaces the pack for upcoming HUD/audio wiring.
- Mission events, checklist steps, failure entries, and DSN communications passes now carry normalized `audio_cue` and channel metadata, with the validator enforcing that every reference resolves against `docs/data/audio_cues.json` so Stage A of the audio dispatcher plan remains deterministic.
- Audio cue binder in [`js/src/audio/audioCueBinder.js`](js/src/audio/audioCueBinder.js) captures scheduler, checklist, failure, and communications triggers as dispatcher-ready records while logging playback metadata to the mission log so the upcoming audio mixer can consume a deterministic queue of mission cues.
- Audio dispatcher runtime in [`js/src/audio/audioDispatcher.js`](js/src/audio/audioDispatcher.js) now drains the binder queue each tick, enforces per-bus concurrency and cooldown rules, applies ducking gains, and logs playback summaries so CLI runs exercise the full cue pipeline before the Web Audio/N64 mixers land.
- `UiFrameBuilder` attaches audio binder and dispatcher summaries (last cue, active/queued bus counts, pending triggers) to each HUD frame, and the CLI text HUD now emits an audio status line so exports, captions, and accessibility tooling can follow cue activity without scraping mission logs.
- Optional EVA-2 contingency timeline entries, surface science extensions, and DSN signal-strength analytics are now captured in the mission datasets (events, checklists, failures) with provenance in `docs/data/provenance.md` and consolidated telemetry in `docs/data/communications_trends.json`.
- `ResourceSystem` ingests the `communications_trends.json` schedule to track active Deep Space Network passes, apply their power-load deltas, and publish HUD-ready communications summaries (current station, time remaining, and next-window countdowns) for the text HUD and upcoming UI views.
- Milestone M1 CLI prototype in [`js/src/index.js`](js/src/index.js) ingests the mission datasets, drives the deterministic scheduler/resource loop, auto-advances checklist procedures through the `ChecklistManager`, supports scripted manual overrides via `ManualActionQueue`, tracks detailed consumable deltas inside [`ResourceSystem`](js/src/sim/resourceSystem.js), and can export deterministic mission logs for regression playback.
- `ResourceSystem` now converts stage-specific propellant draw into updated Δv margins, logging used vs. recovered m/s totals per SPS and LM stage so the HUD, scoring hooks, and parity harness can reason about long-term maneuvering budgets.
- `ResourceSystem` maintains minute-resolution history buffers for power, thermal, propellant, and communications metrics, exposing `historySnapshot()` for UI trend widgets and optionally attaching the data to HUD frames when `includeResourceHistory` is enabled.
- Resource system architecture, consumables integration, and communications scheduling are now documented in [`docs/sim/resource_system.md`](docs/sim/resource_system.md), aligning mission datasets with Δv planning, failure tracking, and HUD consumers.
- Failure manager inside [`ResourceSystem`](js/src/sim/resourceSystem.js) now records the full taxonomy metadata from `docs/data/failures.csv`, latching classification, trigger, penalty, and recovery guidance with first/last-occurrence GET stamps so the HUD, score system, and upcoming UI fault timeline can surface actionable remediation steps instead of bare failure IDs. Breadcrumb synthesis via [`createFailureBreadcrumb`](js/src/sim/failureBreadcrumbs.js) now attaches cause/effect chains (PTC drift, Δv shortfalls, DSN misses) to each failure entry so HUD panes and mission logs can display actionable context.
- Failure breadcrumb subsystem is now fully documented in [`docs/sim/failure_breadcrumbs.md`](docs/sim/failure_breadcrumbs.md), detailing generator mappings for PTC drift, burn deviations, and comms misses plus the resource/UI integration path so HUD alerts, mission logs, and exports stay in sync.
- UI performance telemetry plan in [`docs/ui/performance_telemetry.md`](docs/ui/performance_telemetry.md) outlines frame-time, audio-queue, and input-latency metrics, mission-log hooks, CLI overlays, and N64 profiling so upcoming HUD/audio work ships with deterministic instrumentation across platforms.
- Autopilot runner in [`js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js`](js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js) replays mission automation sequences, logs attitude/ullage/throttle commands (now including linear `throttle_ramp` profiles for maneuvers such as LM powered descent), and applies SPS/LM/RCS propellant usage into the shared `ResourceSystem` using propulsion metadata from `docs/data/autopilots.csv` while exposing burn metrics for HUD and scoring hooks; the runtime contract is now fully documented in [`docs/sim/autopilot_runner.md`](docs/sim/autopilot_runner.md).
- Node-based regression tests under [`js/test/`](js/test) now exercise the autopilot throttle integration, manual action queue execution paths, and UI frame summarization so each pass can run `npm test` to verify core mission automation and HUD summaries.
- `EventScheduler` now consumes the detailed burn summaries emitted by the autopilot runner, compares burn time/propellant/Δv against per-script tolerances, and applies mission failure effects when automation drifts out of limits.
- Event scheduler architecture reference in [`docs/sim/event_scheduler.md`](docs/sim/event_scheduler.md) documents timeline gating, checklist/autopilot coordination, failure handling, and telemetry hooks for upcoming UI and analytics work.
- `RcsController` in [`js/src/sim/rcsController.js`](js/src/sim/rcsController.js) ingests the thruster geometry dataset, resolves translation/torque axis pulses, computes propellant mass and impulse totals for new `rcs_pulse` autopilot commands, and feeds usage metrics into the resource system and HUD summaries.
- Commander rating aggregator in [`js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js`](js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js) tracks event completions, resource minima, comms reliability, thermal violations, and manual contributions, producing weighted base scores plus manual bonuses that surface in the CLI summary and parity harness reports; the runtime contract is now documented in [`docs/sim/score_system.md`](docs/sim/score_system.md).
- `ScoreSystem` now maintains a rolling commander score history, rounds delta contributions per component, and emits `score_delta`/`score_grade_change` mission log entries; `UiFrameBuilder` exports the data via `score.history[]` and `score.rating.delta` so the commander scorecard, timeline annotations, and accessibility tooling stay aligned with the underlying scoring pipeline.
- Progression roadmap in [`docs/scoring/progression_unlocks.md`](docs/scoring/progression_unlocks.md) maps commander scores, event completion stats, and resource margins into deterministic unlock criteria for alternate missions, challenge variants, and cosmetic rewards.
- `ProgressionService` in [`js/src/sim/progressionService.js`](js/src/sim/progressionService.js) now evaluates commander rating summaries, tracks mission completions, applies the documented campaign/challenge unlock rules, and records achievements so profile persistence can mirror milestone goals, with implementation details captured in [`docs/sim/progression_service.md`](docs/sim/progression_service.md).
- CLI entrypoint in [`js/src/index.js`](js/src/index.js) now loads and saves commander progression profiles (using [`js/src/config/profile.js`](js/src/config/profile.js)), exposing `--profile`, `--reset-profile`, `--no-profile`, and `--mission-id` flags so mission runs update unlock state deterministically alongside the summary output.
- Score system regression tests in [`js/test/scoreSystem.test.js`](js/test/scoreSystem.test.js) validate the aggregated event/resource/comms metrics and commander rating outputs so future changes keep the scoring pipeline deterministic.
- Manual vs. auto parity harness in [`js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js`](js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js) replays recorded auto-crew scripts, diffs final event/resource/autopilot states, captures event timeline snapshots for parity comparison, compares filtered mission log streams for frame-level parity, and produces deterministic parity reports to back future regression suites.
- Data validation CLI in [`js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js`](js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js) (`npm run validate:data`) sweeps the mission datasets for GET formatting issues, prerequisite/reference integrity, autopilot asset health (including command payload sanity checks and RCS craft/thruster/tank cross-checks against the thruster geometry and consumables catalogs), PAD parameter JSON validity, consumables budget sanity checks, nested communications metrics, and EVA extension flags.
- Validator coverage now extends to the shared audio cue catalog, checking bus/category IDs, ducking rules, cue durations, cooldowns, and platform asset paths so playback wiring catches schema drift early.
- Mission data validator now ingests the UI definition bundles in `docs/ui/`, ensuring panels, control states, checklist steps, and workspace tiles stay aligned with the mission datasets and surface missing references immediately.
- Python ingestion helpers under `scripts/ingest/ingestlib/` now expose the entry overlay configuration, and the validation sweep checks `docs/ui/entry_overlay.json` for PAD/event references, blackout timing, and recovery milestones so notebooks and datasets stay in lockstep with the UI plan.
- Milestone M2 planning notes outline guidance, RCS, and docking system requirements in [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md) to steer upcoming implementation work.
- Text HUD snapshots generated by [`js/src/hud/textHud.js`](js/src/hud/textHud.js) now surface mission progress, resource margins, propellant usage, T-minus countdowns for upcoming events, active checklist chips, autopilot focus, and caution/warning counts at configurable intervals during CLI runs, aiding long-session monitoring.
- `UiFrameBuilder` in [`js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js`](js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js) consolidates scheduler, resource, autopilot, checklist, AGC, and manual queue state into deterministic `ui_frame` snapshots (documented in [`docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md`](docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md)) so the CLI HUD and upcoming Navigation/Controls/Systems views share a single data contract, including annunciators, register displays, and macro history sourced from the AGC runtime.
- UI frame exporter in [`js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js`](js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js) now forwards the score system so recorded frames include commander rating snapshots alongside the rest of the HUD payload for UI prototyping and regression fixtures.
- UI frame export harness in [`js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js`](js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js) captures deterministic `ui_frame` sequences (metadata + frames) for UI prototyping, accessibility reviews, and regression fixtures aligned with the documented schema.
- Autopilot burn analyzer in [`js/src/tools/analyzeAutopilots.js`](js/src/tools/analyzeAutopilots.js) replays mission slices to compare actual vs. expected burn durations, propellant draw, Δv deltas, and PAD metadata, exiting non-zero when autopilot events fail tolerance checks to keep guidance tuning honest.
- Two-body orbit propagator in [`js/src/sim/orbitPropagator.js`](js/src/sim/orbitPropagator.js) advances the spacecraft state with RK4 integration, records periapsis/apoapsis metrics, tracks applied Δv impulses from autopilot summaries, and supplies `UiFrameBuilder`/HUD consumers with trajectory summaries and history samples for the Navigation view; the architecture and telemetry contract are documented in [`docs/sim/orbit_propagator.md`](docs/sim/orbit_propagator.md).
- Mission log aggregator in [`js/src/logging/missionLogAggregator.js`](js/src/logging/missionLogAggregator.js) normalizes mission logger output into categorized, severity-tagged streams, feeding `UiFrameBuilder` frames, CLI summaries, and export packages with deterministic console data for UI overlays and parity tooling.
- Mission logging emitters across the simulator now attach explicit `logCategory`, `logSeverity`, and `logSource` metadata so downstream HUD, export, and parity consumers operate on pre-classified entries instead of relying on message heuristics.
- Dedicated mission log reference in [`docs/logging/mission_log_reference.md`](docs/logging/mission_log_reference.md) documents the logger/aggregator data contract so CLI runs, HUD snapshots, and parity tooling share the same metadata-rich console feed.
- Input mapping blueprint in [`docs/ui/input_mappings.md`](docs/ui/input_mappings.md) locks in deterministic keyboard, gamepad, and N64 controller bindings, tying each interaction to mission data contracts (`ui_frame`, `panels.json`, `ManualActionQueue`) so future UI work preserves checklist fidelity across platforms.
- AGC and DSKY integration blueprint in [`docs/sim/agc_guidance_integration.md`](docs/sim/agc_guidance_integration.md) maps the guidance runtime, command bus, logging hooks, and validation plan so PAD-driven macros, autopilot programs, and manual inputs share deterministic AGC behaviour across the CLI, upcoming UI, and N64 builds.
- Workspace preset pack in [`docs/ui/workspaces.json`](docs/ui/workspaces.json) defines the Navigation, Docking Ops, Systems Night Watch, and Entry Corridor tile layouts described in the HUD specification so the UI layer can load consistent pane arrangements across web and N64 builds.
- `WorkspaceStore` in [`js/src/hud/workspaceStore.js`](js/src/hud/workspaceStore.js) loads the curated presets, enforces tile constraints during drag/resize mutations, rounds normalized geometry to four decimals, attaches N64-ready quantized coordinates, records override/input history with GET stamps, emits `workspace:*` mission log entries for parity tooling, and serializes layouts for replay/import; coverage lives in [`js/test/workspaceStore.test.js`](js/test/workspaceStore.test.js).
- `UiInputService` in [`js/src/ui/uiInputService.js`](js/src/ui/uiInputService.js) normalizes keyboard, gamepad, and N64 inputs into mission-aware commands, manages view/focus/modal state, logs `ui:command` events, and broadcasts through the shared `MissionEventBus`; regression coverage lives in [`js/test/uiInputService.test.js`](js/test/uiInputService.test.js).
- `UiManualActionDispatcher` in [`js/src/ui/uiManualActionDispatcher.js`](js/src/ui/uiManualActionDispatcher.js) wraps `ManualActionQueue` enqueues for checklist acknowledgements, resource deltas, propellant burns, and DSKY macros while logging, publishing `ui:manual:*` bus events, and optionally mirroring intent into `ManualActionRecorder`; coverage lands in [`js/test/uiManualActionDispatcher.test.js`](js/test/uiManualActionDispatcher.test.js).
- `ManualActionRecorder` in [`js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js`](js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js) now captures `workspace:update`, `workspace:override_changed`, and `workspace:input_override` entries alongside checklist/DSKY actions, exposing `workspaceSnapshot()` and exporting the events in `toJSON()` (including quantized tile coordinates) so parity scripts, CLI exports, and replay tooling can rebuild layout changes deterministically.【F:js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js†L1-L656】【F:js/test/manualActionRecorder.test.js†L1-L32】
- New `npm run export:workspace` CLI in [`js/src/tools/exportWorkspace.js`](js/src/tools/exportWorkspace.js) serializes presets with optional overrides, input remaps, tile mutations, and history flags for UI prototyping and regression fixtures; integration coverage lives in [`js/test/exportWorkspaceIntegration.test.js`](js/test/exportWorkspaceIntegration.test.js).【F:js/src/tools/exportWorkspace.js†L1-L275】【F:js/package.json†L7-L15】【F:js/test/exportWorkspaceIntegration.test.js†L1-L32】
- Panel definition pack in [`docs/ui/panels.json`](docs/ui/panels.json) enumerates the Flight Control, RCS, power, comms, circuit breaker, and LM panel topologies with control metadata so the upcoming UI can highlight dependencies, telemetry hooks, and caution triggers directly from mission truth.
- Checklist prototype bundle in [`docs/ui/checklists.json`](docs/ui/checklists.json) captures high-priority procedures (TLI prep, PTC establishment, LOI config, LM separation, final approach, TEI config) using the new `panels.json` identifiers and DSKY macros to prove the data contract ahead of the interactive build.
- Milestone M3 UI, HUD, and audio telemetry planning in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md) defines presentation-layer architecture, cue taxonomy, and accessibility handoff targets for the JS prototype and N64 port.
- Docking gate dataset in [`docs/ui/docking_gates.json`](docs/ui/docking_gates.json) and the expanded `UiFrameBuilder` expose rendezvous braking gates, checklist linkage, and progress/RCs summaries so the docking overlay mirrors the Flight Plan braking cadence.
- Entry corridor overlay config in [`docs/ui/entry_overlay.json`](docs/ui/entry_overlay.json) now feeds `UiFrameBuilder`'s `frame.entry` block with PAD-aligned corridor angles, blackout timing, EMS targets, and recovery milestones so Navigation/Systems overlays can surface TEI → splashdown telemetry without recomputing mission data.
- Detailed HUD and pane layout specification in [`docs/ui/hud_layout.md`](docs/ui/hud_layout.md) locks in the Always-On HUD modules, Navigation/Controls/Systems view grids, tile-mode presets, and data-binding strategy that the M3 UI build will implement across the web and N64 targets.
- Commander rating integration in [`docs/ui/hud_layout.md`](docs/ui/hud_layout.md), [`docs/ui/view_data_bindings.md`](docs/ui/view_data_bindings.md), and [`docs/ui/workspaces.json`](docs/ui/workspaces.json) adds the Always-On score capsule, Systems view scorecard, and tile-mode placements wired to the `UiFrameBuilder` `score` block so mission health trends surface alongside resource telemetry.
- Commander scorecard blueprint in [`docs/ui/commander_scorecard.md`](docs/ui/commander_scorecard.md) translates the `ScoreSystem` summary into Systems-view layout modules, thresholds, and logging hooks so browser and N64 builds surface identical grade feedback and manual participation cues.

- Milestone M7 stability plan in [`docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md`](docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md) details soak-testing strategy, fault injection coverage, and automation expectations for release readiness.
- Manual action recorder in [`js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js`](js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js) can capture auto-advanced checklist steps and export them via the CLI `--record-manual-script` flag for deterministic manual-vs-auto parity runs.
- `ManualActionQueue` now accepts `dsky_entry` actions so scripted runs and future UI flows can log Verb/Noun inputs and macro payloads for AGC integration while keeping the mission log authoritative.
- `AutopilotRunner` now interprets `dsky_entry` commands, logging Verb/Noun payloads and forwarding them to the manual action recorder so recorded scripts retain AGC macro usage for parity replays and UI prototypes.
- Deterministic AGC bridge in [`js/src/sim/agcRuntime.js`](js/src/sim/agcRuntime.js) ingests the curated DSKY macro pack ([`docs/ui/dsky_macros.json`](docs/ui/dsky_macros.json)), tracks annunciators, program state, register history, and pending PRO acknowledgements, and feeds both the HUD (`UiFrameBuilder`) and mission logs so manual and automated macro execution share a single data contract documented in [`docs/ui/dsky_reference.md`](docs/ui/dsky_reference.md).
- Targeted AGC runtime unit tests in [`js/test/agcRuntime.test.js`](js/test/agcRuntime.test.js) exercise macro execution, annunciator gating, acknowledgement flow, and rejection handling so the simulator flags regressions before UI or dataset changes ship.
- `MissionLogAggregator` and the CLI HUD now classify AGC traffic under a dedicated `agc` category, capturing macro executions, acknowledgements, and annunciator transitions alongside existing event, resource, audio, and checklist streams.
- Manual interaction contract documented in [`docs/ui/manual_actions_reference.md`](docs/ui/manual_actions_reference.md) so the upcoming UI dispatcher, parity tooling, and ingestion notebooks share a single source of truth for queueing checklist acknowledgements, resource deltas, propellant burns, and DSKY macros.
- Autopilot authoring reference in [`docs/data/autopilot_scripts.md`](docs/data/autopilot_scripts.md) details the CSV/JSON schema, command vocabulary, propulsion metadata, and validation workflow so new burn profiles stay aligned with the simulator and parity harness.
- Ingestion workflow planning under [`scripts/ingest/`](scripts/ingest/README.md) and [`docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md`](docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md) now documents how future dataset updates move from annotated sources into the CSV/JSON packs, including notebook sequencing, validation checkpoints, and automation hooks.
- Shared Python helpers under [`scripts/ingest/ingestlib/`](scripts/ingest/ingestlib) expose GET utilities, typed dataset loaders, validation routines, and provenance table builders so notebooks and future automation reuse a single source of truth.
- Ingestion helpers now ship typed DSKY macro records/validation (`UiDskyMacro*`) and surface `docs/ui/dsky_macros.json` through `MissionData` so notebooks and validators can cross-link macros with panels, checklists, and mission datasets without ad-hoc parsing.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Continue Milestone M0 by publishing ingestion notebooks under `scripts/ingest/`, rounding out contingency datasets, and wiring the new EVA/DSN analytics into automated regression notebooks while extending the validation CLI as new schema fields appear.
2. Integrate the new manual/auto parity harness (`npm run parity`) into routine regression workflows, now leveraging log-stream comparisons alongside event/resource/autopilot diffs, while continuing autopilot burn calibration (verifying mass-flow assumptions against mission data) and expanding deterministic replay suites that exercise the manual action queue and resource deltas.
3. Prepare for Milestone M2 execution by deriving thruster configuration tables, validating autopilot script needs, and planning rendezvous tuning sessions following [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md).
4. Capture Milestone M3 presentation-layer requirements by prototyping HUD layouts, audio cue routing, and accessibility tooling as described in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md).
