# Apollo 11 Real-Time Mission Simulator

This repository has been reset to develop a real-time Apollo 11 mission simulator that can run both as a browser-based proof of concept and, eventually, as a Nintendo 64 experience. All design goals and roadmap details live in [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md), with milestone-specific execution notes collected under [`docs/milestones/`](docs/milestones).

## Repository Layout
- `js/` – Workspace for the JavaScript/Web prototype that will validate the mission model and user experience.
- `n64/` – Workspace for the libdragon-powered Nintendo 64 port that inherits the proven systems from the web build.
- `docs/` – Planning and reference material for the project, including the current mission and technology plan.
- `scripts/ingest/` – Planned notebooks and helper modules that turn annotated research assets into the committed datasets.

## Current Progress
- Milestone M0 datasets now cover launch through splashdown, capturing extended Passive Thermal Control maintenance, MCC-1/2/3/4 PAD workflows, LOI-focused navigation realignments, DOI planning, LM separation, powered descent and landing safing, surface EVA-1 prep/egress/traverse/closeout, ascent/docking evaluation, TEI preparation and execution, transearth DSN communications passes, MCC-5 return corrections, entry PAD alignment, service module jettison, and recovery procedures.
- A new `docs/data/consumables.json` pack records baseline power, propellant, and life-support budgets with citations into the Apollo 11 Mission Operations Report and Flight Plan, enabling simulation modules to initialize realistic resource margins.
- Fresh `docs/data/thrusters.json` geometry maps the CSM and LM reaction-control clusters (radius, angles, translation/torque axes, and thrust/impulse defaults) so Milestone M2 can plug guidance tuning directly into the simulator.
- Optional EVA-2 contingency timeline entries, surface science extensions, and DSN signal-strength analytics are now captured in the mission datasets (events, checklists, failures) with provenance in `docs/data/provenance.md` and consolidated telemetry in `docs/data/communications_trends.json`.
- Milestone M1 CLI prototype in [`js/src/index.js`](js/src/index.js) ingests the mission datasets, drives the deterministic scheduler/resource loop, auto-advances checklist procedures through the `ChecklistManager`, supports scripted manual overrides via `ManualActionQueue`, tracks detailed consumable deltas inside [`ResourceSystem`](js/src/sim/resourceSystem.js), and can export deterministic mission logs for regression playback.
- `ResourceSystem` now converts SPS propellant draw into updated Δv margins, logging used vs. recovered m/s totals so the HUD, scoring hooks, and parity harness can reason about long-term maneuvering budgets.
- Autopilot runner in [`js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js`](js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js) replays mission automation sequences, logs attitude/ullage/throttle commands (now including linear `throttle_ramp` profiles for maneuvers such as LM powered descent), and applies SPS/LM/RCS propellant usage into the shared `ResourceSystem` using propulsion metadata from `docs/data/autopilots.csv` while exposing burn metrics for HUD and scoring hooks.
- `RcsController` in [`js/src/sim/rcsController.js`](js/src/sim/rcsController.js) ingests the thruster geometry dataset, resolves translation/torque axis pulses, computes propellant mass and impulse totals for new `rcs_pulse` autopilot commands, and feeds usage metrics into the resource system and HUD summaries.
- Commander rating aggregator in [`js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js`](js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js) tracks event completions, resource minima, comms reliability, thermal violations, and manual contributions, producing weighted base scores plus manual bonuses that surface in the CLI summary and parity harness reports.
- Manual vs. auto parity harness in [`js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js`](js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js) replays recorded auto-crew scripts, diffs final event/resource/autopilot states, captures event timeline snapshots for parity comparison, compares filtered mission log streams for frame-level parity, and produces deterministic parity reports to back future regression suites.
- Data validation CLI in [`js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js`](js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js) (`npm run validate:data`) sweeps the mission datasets for GET formatting issues, prerequisite/reference integrity, autopilot asset health, PAD parameter JSON validity, consumables budget sanity checks, nested communications metrics, and EVA extension flags.
- Milestone M2 planning notes outline guidance, RCS, and docking system requirements in [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md) to steer upcoming implementation work.
- Text HUD snapshots generated by [`js/src/hud/textHud.js`](js/src/hud/textHud.js) now surface mission progress, resource margins, propellant usage, T-minus countdowns for upcoming events, active checklist chips, autopilot focus, and caution/warning counts at configurable intervals during CLI runs, aiding long-session monitoring.
- `UiFrameBuilder` in [`js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js`](js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js) consolidates scheduler, resource, autopilot, checklist, and manual queue state into deterministic `ui_frame` snapshots (documented in [`docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md`](docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md)) so the CLI HUD and upcoming Navigation/Controls/Systems views share a single data contract.
- Milestone M3 UI, HUD, and audio telemetry planning in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md) defines presentation-layer architecture, cue taxonomy, and accessibility handoff targets for the JS prototype and N64 port.
- Detailed HUD and pane layout specification in [`docs/ui/hud_layout.md`](docs/ui/hud_layout.md) locks in the Always-On HUD modules, Navigation/Controls/Systems view grids, tile-mode presets, and data-binding strategy that the M3 UI build will implement across the web and N64 targets.
- Milestone M4 N64 port plan in [`docs/milestones/M4_N64_PORT.md`](docs/milestones/M4_N64_PORT.md) maps the libdragon architecture, rendering/audio budgets, input scheme, and asset pipeline for the hardware build.
- Milestone M5 content integration roadmap in [`docs/milestones/M5_CONTENT_PASS.md`](docs/milestones/M5_CONTENT_PASS.md) itemizes the remaining dataset ingestion work, contingency branches, and ingestion tooling required for the full mission graph.
- Milestone M6 fidelity pass outline in [`docs/milestones/M6_FIDELITY_PASS.md`](docs/milestones/M6_FIDELITY_PASS.md) defines calibration targets for timelines, propulsion, resources, and communications against Apollo 11 telemetry.
- Milestone M7 stability plan in [`docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md`](docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md) details soak-testing strategy, fault injection coverage, and automation expectations for release readiness.
- Manual action recorder in [`js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js`](js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js) can capture auto-advanced checklist steps and export them via the CLI `--record-manual-script` flag for deterministic manual-vs-auto parity runs.
- Ingestion workflow planning under [`scripts/ingest/`](scripts/ingest/README.md) and [`docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md`](docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md) now documents how future dataset updates move from annotated sources into the CSV/JSON packs, including notebook sequencing, validation checkpoints, and automation hooks.
- Shared Python helpers under [`scripts/ingest/ingestlib/`](scripts/ingest/ingestlib) expose GET utilities, typed dataset loaders, validation routines, and provenance table builders so notebooks and future automation reuse a single source of truth.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Continue Milestone M0 by publishing ingestion notebooks under `scripts/ingest/`, rounding out contingency datasets, and wiring the new EVA/DSN analytics into automated regression notebooks while extending the validation CLI as new schema fields appear.
2. Integrate the new manual/auto parity harness (`npm run parity`) into routine regression workflows, now leveraging log-stream comparisons alongside event/resource/autopilot diffs, while continuing autopilot burn calibration (verifying mass-flow assumptions against mission data) and expanding deterministic replay suites that exercise the manual action queue and resource deltas.
3. Prepare for Milestone M2 execution by deriving thruster configuration tables, validating autopilot script needs, and planning rendezvous tuning sessions following [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md).
4. Capture Milestone M3 presentation-layer requirements by prototyping HUD layouts, audio cue routing, and accessibility tooling as described in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md).
