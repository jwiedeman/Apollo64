# Apollo 11 Real-Time Mission Simulator

This repository has been reset to develop a real-time Apollo 11 mission simulator that can run both as a browser-based proof of concept and, eventually, as a Nintendo 64 experience. All design goals and roadmap details live in [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md), with milestone-specific execution notes collected under [`docs/milestones/`](docs/milestones).

## Repository Layout
- `js/` – Workspace for the JavaScript/Web prototype that will validate the mission model and user experience.
- `n64/` – Workspace for the libdragon-powered Nintendo 64 port that inherits the proven systems from the web build.
- `docs/` – Planning and reference material for the project, including the current mission and technology plan.
- `scripts/ingest/` – Planned notebooks and helper modules that turn annotated research assets into the committed datasets.

## Current Progress
- Milestone M0 datasets now cover launch through splashdown, capturing extended Passive Thermal Control maintenance, MCC-1/2/3/4 PAD workflows, LOI-focused navigation realignments, DOI planning, LM separation, powered descent and landing safing, surface EVA-1 prep/egress/traverse/closeout, ascent/docking evaluation, TEI preparation and execution, transearth DSN communications passes, MCC-5 return corrections, entry PAD alignment, service module jettison, and recovery procedures.
- A new `docs/data/consumables.json` pack records baseline power, propellant, and life-support budgets with citations into the Apollo 11 Mission Operations Report and Flight Plan, enabling simulation modules to initialize realistic resource margins.
- Fresh `docs/data/thrusters.json` geometry maps the CSM and LM reaction-control clusters (radius, angles, translation/torque axes, and thrust/impulse defaults) so Milestone M2 can plug guidance tuning directly into the simulator.
- `docs/data/audio_cues.json` now catalogs buses, categories, and prioritized cues (alerts, callouts, telemetry hints, UI feedback, and ambience) pulled from Apollo 11 transcripts and Mission Operations Report references, and the mission data loader surfaces the pack for upcoming HUD/audio wiring.
- Optional EVA-2 contingency timeline entries, surface science extensions, and DSN signal-strength analytics are now captured in the mission datasets (events, checklists, failures) with provenance in `docs/data/provenance.md` and consolidated telemetry in `docs/data/communications_trends.json`.
- `ResourceSystem` ingests the `communications_trends.json` schedule to track active Deep Space Network passes, apply their power-load deltas, and publish HUD-ready communications summaries (current station, time remaining, and next-window countdowns) for the text HUD and upcoming UI views.
- Milestone M1 CLI prototype in [`js/src/index.js`](js/src/index.js) ingests the mission datasets, drives the deterministic scheduler/resource loop, auto-advances checklist procedures through the `ChecklistManager`, supports scripted manual overrides via `ManualActionQueue`, tracks detailed consumable deltas inside [`ResourceSystem`](js/src/sim/resourceSystem.js), and can export deterministic mission logs for regression playback.
- `ResourceSystem` now converts SPS propellant draw into updated Δv margins, logging used vs. recovered m/s totals so the HUD, scoring hooks, and parity harness can reason about long-term maneuvering budgets.
- `ResourceSystem` maintains minute-resolution history buffers for power, thermal, propellant, and communications metrics, exposing `historySnapshot()` for UI trend widgets and optionally attaching the data to HUD frames when `includeResourceHistory` is enabled.
- Failure manager inside [`ResourceSystem`](js/src/sim/resourceSystem.js) now records the full taxonomy metadata from `docs/data/failures.csv`, latching classification, trigger, penalty, and recovery guidance with first/last-occurrence GET stamps so the HUD, score system, and upcoming UI fault timeline can surface actionable remediation steps instead of bare failure IDs.
- Autopilot runner in [`js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js`](js/src/sim/autopilotRunner.js) replays mission automation sequences, logs attitude/ullage/throttle commands (now including linear `throttle_ramp` profiles for maneuvers such as LM powered descent), and applies SPS/LM/RCS propellant usage into the shared `ResourceSystem` using propulsion metadata from `docs/data/autopilots.csv` while exposing burn metrics for HUD and scoring hooks.
- Node-based regression tests under [`js/test/`](js/test) now exercise the autopilot throttle integration, manual action queue execution paths, and UI frame summarization so each pass can run `npm test` to verify core mission automation and HUD summaries.
- `EventScheduler` now consumes the detailed burn summaries emitted by the autopilot runner, compares burn time/propellant/Δv against per-script tolerances, and applies mission failure effects when automation drifts out of limits.
- `RcsController` in [`js/src/sim/rcsController.js`](js/src/sim/rcsController.js) ingests the thruster geometry dataset, resolves translation/torque axis pulses, computes propellant mass and impulse totals for new `rcs_pulse` autopilot commands, and feeds usage metrics into the resource system and HUD summaries.
- Commander rating aggregator in [`js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js`](js/src/sim/scoreSystem.js) tracks event completions, resource minima, comms reliability, thermal violations, and manual contributions, producing weighted base scores plus manual bonuses that surface in the CLI summary and parity harness reports.
- Manual vs. auto parity harness in [`js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js`](js/src/tools/runParityCheck.js) replays recorded auto-crew scripts, diffs final event/resource/autopilot states, captures event timeline snapshots for parity comparison, compares filtered mission log streams for frame-level parity, and produces deterministic parity reports to back future regression suites.
- Data validation CLI in [`js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js`](js/src/tools/validateMissionData.js) (`npm run validate:data`) sweeps the mission datasets for GET formatting issues, prerequisite/reference integrity, autopilot asset health, PAD parameter JSON validity, consumables budget sanity checks, nested communications metrics, and EVA extension flags.
- Validator coverage now extends to the shared audio cue catalog, checking bus/category IDs, ducking rules, cue durations, cooldowns, and platform asset paths so playback wiring catches schema drift early.
- Milestone M2 planning notes outline guidance, RCS, and docking system requirements in [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md) to steer upcoming implementation work.
- Text HUD snapshots generated by [`js/src/hud/textHud.js`](js/src/hud/textHud.js) now surface mission progress, resource margins, propellant usage, T-minus countdowns for upcoming events, active checklist chips, autopilot focus, and caution/warning counts at configurable intervals during CLI runs, aiding long-session monitoring.
- `UiFrameBuilder` in [`js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js`](js/src/hud/uiFrameBuilder.js) consolidates scheduler, resource, autopilot, checklist, and manual queue state into deterministic `ui_frame` snapshots (documented in [`docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md`](docs/ui/ui_frame_reference.md)) so the CLI HUD and upcoming Navigation/Controls/Systems views share a single data contract.
- UI frame exporter in [`js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js`](js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js) now forwards the score system so recorded frames include commander rating snapshots alongside the rest of the HUD payload for UI prototyping and regression fixtures.
- UI frame export harness in [`js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js`](js/src/tools/exportUiFrames.js) captures deterministic `ui_frame` sequences (metadata + frames) for UI prototyping, accessibility reviews, and regression fixtures aligned with the documented schema.
- Workspace preset pack in [`docs/ui/workspaces.json`](docs/ui/workspaces.json) defines the Navigation, Docking Ops, Systems Night Watch, and Entry Corridor tile layouts described in the HUD specification so the UI layer can load consistent pane arrangements across web and N64 builds.
- Panel definition pack in [`docs/ui/panels.json`](docs/ui/panels.json) enumerates the Flight Control, RCS, power, comms, circuit breaker, and LM panel topologies with control metadata so the upcoming UI can highlight dependencies, telemetry hooks, and caution triggers directly from mission truth.
- Checklist prototype bundle in [`docs/ui/checklists.json`](docs/ui/checklists.json) captures high-priority procedures (TLI prep, PTC establishment, LOI config, LM separation, final approach, TEI config) using the new `panels.json` identifiers and DSKY macros to prove the data contract ahead of the interactive build.
- Milestone M3 UI, HUD, and audio telemetry planning in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md) defines presentation-layer architecture, cue taxonomy, and accessibility handoff targets for the JS prototype and N64 port.
- Detailed HUD and pane layout specification in [`docs/ui/hud_layout.md`](docs/ui/hud_layout.md) locks in the Always-On HUD modules, Navigation/Controls/Systems view grids, tile-mode presets, and data-binding strategy that the M3 UI build will implement across the web and N64 targets.
- UI component architecture blueprint in [`docs/ui/component_architecture.md`](docs/ui/component_architecture.md) maps the pane/component tree, `ui_frame` ingestion flow, tile workspace persistence, and accessibility hooks that keep the Always-On HUD authoritative across web and N64 builds.
- Audio cue taxonomy and routing plan in [`docs/ui/audio_cue_taxonomy.md`](docs/ui/audio_cue_taxonomy.md) defines cue categories, priority/ducking rules, dataset hooks, and asset specs so the upcoming dispatcher can balance alerts, callouts, ambience, and UI feedback consistently.
- Milestone M4 N64 port plan in [`docs/milestones/M4_N64_PORT.md`](docs/milestones/M4_N64_PORT.md) maps the libdragon architecture, rendering/audio budgets, input scheme, and asset pipeline for the hardware build.
- Milestone M5 content integration roadmap in [`docs/milestones/M5_CONTENT_PASS.md`](docs/milestones/M5_CONTENT_PASS.md) itemizes the remaining dataset ingestion work, contingency branches, and ingestion tooling required for the full mission graph.
- Milestone M6 fidelity pass outline in [`docs/milestones/M6_FIDELITY_PASS.md`](docs/milestones/M6_FIDELITY_PASS.md) defines calibration targets for timelines, propulsion, resources, and communications against Apollo 11 telemetry.
- Milestone M7 stability plan in [`docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md`](docs/milestones/M7_STABILITY_FAULTS.md) details soak-testing strategy, fault injection coverage, and automation expectations for release readiness.
- Manual action recorder in [`js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js`](js/src/logging/manualActionRecorder.js) can capture auto-advanced checklist steps and export them via the CLI `--record-manual-script` flag for deterministic manual-vs-auto parity runs.
- `ManualActionQueue` now accepts `dsky_entry` actions so scripted runs and future UI flows can log Verb/Noun inputs and macro payloads for AGC integration while keeping the mission log authoritative.
- `AutopilotRunner` now interprets `dsky_entry` commands, logging Verb/Noun payloads and forwarding them to the manual action recorder so recorded scripts retain AGC macro usage for parity replays and UI prototypes.
- Autopilot authoring reference in [`docs/data/autopilot_scripts.md`](docs/data/autopilot_scripts.md) details the CSV/JSON schema, command vocabulary, propulsion metadata, and validation workflow so new burn profiles stay aligned with the simulator and parity harness.
- Ingestion workflow planning under [`scripts/ingest/`](scripts/ingest/README.md) and [`docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md`](docs/data/INGESTION_PIPELINE.md) now documents how future dataset updates move from annotated sources into the CSV/JSON packs, including notebook sequencing, validation checkpoints, and automation hooks.
- Shared Python helpers under [`scripts/ingest/ingestlib/`](scripts/ingest/ingestlib) expose GET utilities, typed dataset loaders, validation routines, and provenance table builders so notebooks and future automation reuse a single source of truth.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Continue Milestone M0 by publishing ingestion notebooks under `scripts/ingest/`, rounding out contingency datasets, and wiring the new EVA/DSN analytics into automated regression notebooks while extending the validation CLI as new schema fields appear.
2. Integrate the new manual/auto parity harness (`npm run parity`) into routine regression workflows, now leveraging log-stream comparisons alongside event/resource/autopilot diffs, while continuing autopilot burn calibration (verifying mass-flow assumptions against mission data) and expanding deterministic replay suites that exercise the manual action queue and resource deltas.
3. Prepare for Milestone M2 execution by deriving thruster configuration tables, validating autopilot script needs, and planning rendezvous tuning sessions following [`docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md`](docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md).
4. Capture Milestone M3 presentation-layer requirements by prototyping HUD layouts, audio cue routing, and accessibility tooling as described in [`docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md`](docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md).
