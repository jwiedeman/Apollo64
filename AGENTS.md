# Agent Instructions

Scope: This file applies to the entire repository.

## Project focus
- This repo was reset for the Apollo 11 real-time mission simulation project described in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
- Maintain two top-level implementation tracks: `js/` for the browser prototype and `n64/` for the eventual Nintendo 64 build.

## Contribution guidelines
- Keep the high-level roadmap and architectural intent up to date in `README.md` and supporting docs under `docs/`.
- Prefer Markdown documentation until an implementation pass begins for each platform.
- When adding code, ensure platform-specific documentation exists in the corresponding folder.
- At this stage there are no automated tests; document any manual validation steps performed.
