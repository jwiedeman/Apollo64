# JS Prototype Workspace

This folder will host the web-based proof of concept for the Apollo 11 mission simulator. Initial objectives:

1. Implement the deterministic mission scheduler and event data ingestion described in the project plan and expanded in the milestone notes for [M0](../docs/milestones/M0_DATA_INGESTION.md) and [M1](../docs/milestones/M1_CORE_SYSTEMS.md).
2. Build a lightweight UI that surfaces GET, upcoming events, and resource states following the presentation roadmap in [M3](../docs/milestones/M3_UI_AUDIO.md).
3. Prototype physics, guidance, and failure cascades—including the rendezvous and docking flow scoped in [M2](../docs/milestones/M2_GUIDANCE_RCS.md)—to validate balancing before porting to N64.

Until the simulation code exists, keep this directory focused on documentation, data definitions, and small prototypes.
