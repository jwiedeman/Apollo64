# JS Prototype Workspace

This folder will host the web-based proof of concept for the Apollo 11 mission simulator. Initial objectives:

1. Implement the deterministic mission scheduler and event data ingestion described in the project plan.
2. Build a lightweight UI that surfaces GET, upcoming events, and resource states.
3. Prototype physics, guidance, and failure cascades to validate balancing before porting to N64.

Until the simulation code exists, keep this directory focused on documentation, data definitions, and small prototypes.
